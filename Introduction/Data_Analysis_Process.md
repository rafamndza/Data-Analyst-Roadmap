# Data analysis process

The data analysis process is composed of the six phases of ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act. Their purpose is to gain insights that drive informed decision-making.

The data analysis process helps analysts break down business problems into a series of manageable tasks:

## Ask

You’ll work to understand the challenge to be solved or the question to be answered. It will likely be assigned to you by stakeholders. As this is the ask phase, you’ll ask many questions to help you along the way.

## Prepare

You’ll find and collect the data you'll need to answer your questions. You’ll identify data sources, gather data, and verify that it is accurate and useful for answering your questions.

## Process

You will clean and organize your data. Tasks you perform here include removing any inconsistencies; filling in missing values; and, in many cases, changing the data to a format that's easier to work with. Essentially, you’re ensuring the data is ready before you begin analysis.

## Analyze

You do the necessary data analysis to uncover answers and solutions. Depending on the situation and the data, this could involve tasks such as calculating averages or counting items in categories so you can examine trends and patterns.

## Share

You present your findings to decision-makers through a report, presentation, or data visualizations. As part of the share phase, you decide which medium you want to use to share your findings and select the data to include. Tools for presenting data visually include charts made in Google Sheets, Tableau, and R.

## Act

## You and others in the company put the data insights into action. This could mean implementing a new business strategy, making changes to a website, or any other action that solves the initial problem.

# Whats the difference between data science and data analytics?

These are two terms usually confused but what they do is actually very different.

Data Science: is defined as creating new ways of modeling and understanding the unkown by using raw data, Data scientist create new questions using data while analysists find answers to existing questions by creating insights from data sources.

Putting data to work is defined with the term **Data-driven decision-making** which uses facts to guide business strategy.
